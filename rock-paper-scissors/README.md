# Rock Paper Scissors  

## Description  

This is a simple, interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built as part of my JavaScript learning journey while following the free JavaScript course by **Simon Bao** on the **SuperSimpleDev** YouTube channel.  

The game features:  
- Playable with buttons or keyboard shortcuts (`r`, `p`, `s`)  
- Persistent score tracking using `localStorage`  
- Fun emoji-based visuals for player and computer choices  
- Reset score confirmation overlay  

I have made some slight changes to appearance.
