# JavaScript Practice Exercises  

## Description  

This repository contains **three simple, one-page exercises** created while following the free JavaScript course by **Simon Bao** on the **SuperSimpleDev** YouTube channel.  

The exercises are:  
1. Rock Paper Scissors  
2. Calculator  
3. To-Do List  

Although the course focuses on JavaScript, I also wrote my own HTML and CSS to complement the lessons. These projects are for **learning purposes only** ‚Äî and since I‚Äôm still learning, you may find the occasional ‚Äúfeature‚Äù (a.k.a. glitch) that snuck in.  

In the future, I may revisit and improve these exercises as my skills grow.  

## Course Information & Credits
