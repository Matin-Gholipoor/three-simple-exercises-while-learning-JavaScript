# Calculator  

## Description  

This is a simple, one-page calculator built as part of my JavaScript learning journey while following the free JavaScript course by **Simon Bao** on the **SuperSimpleDev** YouTube channel.  

The calculator supports:  
- Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
- Decimal numbers  
- Clear function  
- Keyboard input support  

I have made some slight changes to appearance.
