# ToDo List

## Description  

This is a simple, interactive ToDo List built as part of my JavaScript learning journey while following the free JavaScript course by **Simon Bao** on the **SuperSimpleDev** YouTube channel.  

Features of ToDo list:  
- Adding and deleting tasks.
- Prevent you from adding an empty task.

I have made some slight changes to appearance.
